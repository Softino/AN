# Canfis

this is a simple canfis code for people who wants a quick run without major changes in code. and also be able to understand the algorithem. I have coded it myself. feel free to ask question if you don't understand the code. the code is simple and you can change it through the number of inputs and outputs, number of membership functions. the other parameters can be changed such as Activation functions but it requiers majore changes in code.
for thoes who don't know what the CANFIS is: it combines the power of phazy logic with neural networks.
