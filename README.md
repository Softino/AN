# Canfis

this is a simple CANFIS code for people who wants a quick run without major changes in code. and also be able to understand the algorithm. I have coded it myself. feel free to ask questions if you don't understand the code. the code is simple and you can change it through the number of inputs and outputs and the number of membership functions. the other parameters can be changed such as Activation functions but it requires major changes in code.
for those who don't know what the CANFIS is: it combines the power of fuzzy logic with neural networks.
